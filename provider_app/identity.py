"""Verify the launched EHR patient is the same person as the resolved JHE record.

The MRN join (patient_resolver) is the only link between the EHR and JHE; a wrong
or stale external identifier in JHE would silently surface another patient's data.
This guard re-reads the EHR Patient's demographics from the SMART launch and refuses
to proceed unless they match the JHE record. It fails CLOSED: if the EHR identity
cannot be read at all, we raise rather than display anything.

We compare family name + birth date only. Given names vary legitimately (nicknames,
e.g. May/Mary) and would cause false mismatches; family name + DOB is a robust,
low-false-positive check for "same person" in this single-MRN lookup context.
